# Final Project Repository

Welcome to my final project repository! This project focuses on looking at bike demand based on weather conditions in Seoul, South Korea from multiple different viewpoints. Below, you'll find an organized structure and key documents related to the project.

## Project Structure
`data/` : Contains datasets used in the analysis.

`seoulbikedemand_app/`: Stores visualizations and figures generated during the analysis.

`rscripts/` : Holds R scripts used for data formatting and processing.

## Documents
`Nelson_Chelsea_additional_information.html` : Additional information document in HTML format.

`Nelson_Chelsea_additional_information.qmd` : Quarto source document for the additional information.

`Nelson_Chelsea_progress_memo.html` : Progress memo  in HTML format.

`Nelson_Chelsea_progress_memo.qmd` : Quarto source document for the progress memo .

## Usage
I would recommend starting with  `seoulbikedemand_app/app.R` and running the 
application to see the full final dashboard. However, If you want to explore or 
run the code, then I would recommend looking at `rscripts/0-data_collection_wrangling.R` 
and `rscripts/1-data_formatting.R`. Through each of the rscripts, you will be 
able to get a feel of my thought process and see how I went about exploring 
the data, as well as being able to conduct your own explorations as well.

## Acknowledgments
I have already called any external libraries in at the beginning of each R file if needed throughout looking through my exploration.

All references to external sources and information used have been highlighted and can be found on the first page of the `seoulbikedemand_app/app.R` associated dashboard application.
